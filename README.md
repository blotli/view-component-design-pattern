# Cogent <!-- omit in toc -->

_Cogent_ is a simple design pattern for JavaScript frontend development.

This is a work in progress.

## Components

### Overview

#### An app is a hierarchy of components.

#### A component has a view that is parented by a single top-level HTMLElement.

Think of HTML/CSS as the language to describe the view.

#### Each component is a CHESS component as well.

#### External code can read or mutate the top-level view node using the node's API or the component's API. However, external code cannot change the top-level node's internal HTML structure directly through the top-level node, only the component API can.

Think of the internal structure as a closed shadow DOM. Only component-level APIs can change the internal structure.

#### A component "owns" a slice of the application state if it is the first component that needs the state, or is the shared parent of the components that need the state.

"State" is any data used or displayed by the application.

#### Notifications of state updates flow downwards from the owning component.

Child components can read or update state that is owned higher up, but the notification of the state change should flow downwards to each interested component in a top-down manner.

This ensures that parents react to changes before children.

#### Child components can "lift state up" by calling callbacks passed to them or by using the service pattern.

More on the service pattern later.

### API

#### Hang the top-level node from the `$` property of the component.

#### Components only take a single object parameter on initialization called props.

This way it is easy to pass around classes, initialization objects (props), and use mixins.

Any properties on the props object that are not used by the component API are sent to the underlying view element's properties, attributes, or methods.

## Service Pattern

### Overview

#### A single component may delegate to a "service" the management of an aspect of state owned by the initializing component, and/or expose methods for child components to lift state up and dispatch updates.

Delegation can simply be intent, no need to explicitly pass owning component to service if unnecessary.

#### Service can do anything that the delegator can.

#### Services can be registered and then used by any component to update state or read state. Updates need to flow downwards through all the notified components from the owning component.

Service can automatically send notifications based on tree structure, which ensures a top-down flow.

That's it. Don't overthink it.

## Other

### Shadow DOM

#### Great concept, with the fatal flaw of styling.

Styles must be created either in a `style` tag in each component or link to a preloaded stylesheet. Parsing an entire stylesheet for every component must have negative performance implications.

A solution is `adopted stylesheets`. However, it does not work in Safari.

Shadow DOM also precludes parents from changing styling in child fragments, although this may be a feature rather than a bug.

Shadow DOM would also preclude a `props` sent to the constructor, which is convenient.

If styling gets resolved, components _could_ simply become HTMLElements and drop the `$` property altogether.

Alternatively, you could keep the `$` syntax and just use the Shadow DOM to isolate the internal structure and styling. The advantage here is that you could continue to use `props` in the constructor.

### Custom Elements

#### No children or attributes may be set in the constructor, like a normal `document.createElement()`.

This is fatal because it requires tracking when the component mounts or when properties change, etc. Render becomes indeterminate. Also, pressure to reflect properties to attributes.
